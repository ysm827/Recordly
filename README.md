### Create polished, pro-grade screen recordings.
[Recordly](https://www.recordly.dev) is an **open-source screen recorder and editor** for creating **polished walkthroughs, demos, tutorials, and product videos**. Contribution encouraged.

**FAQ**: What are the changes between this and the **upstream project?** A: Recordly adds a full cursor animation/rendering pipeline, native macOS and Windows screen recording system, zoom animations faithful to Screen Studio, cursor loops, audio tracks, and more major tweaks.

## What is Recordly?

Recordly lets you record your screen and automatically transform it into a polished video. It handles the heavy lifting of zooming into important actions and smoothing out jittery cursor movement so your demos look professional by default.

Recordly runs on:

- **macOS** 12.3+
- **Windows** 10 Build 19041+
- **Linux** (modern distros)

On Windows, builds older than 19041 fall back to Electron capture and the cursor cannot be hidden. On Linux, cursor hiding is not supported (contribute).

# Installation

## Download a build

Prebuilt releases are available here:

https://github.com/webadderall/Recordly/releases

## Homebrew (Cask)

Recordly is distributed as a GUI app, so Homebrew support is done via cask.

For users:

```bash
brew tap webadderall/tap
brew install --cask recordly
```

---

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webadderall/Recordly.git recordly
cd recordly
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## macOS: "App cannot be opened"

Recordly is not signed. macOS may quarantine locally built apps.

Remove the quarantine flag with:

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Recordly.app
```

# System Requirements

| Platform | Minimum version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | macOS 12.3 (Monterey) | Required for ScreenCaptureKit. Recording and cursor hiding will not work on older versions. |
| **Windows** | Windows 10 20H1 (Build 19041, May 2020) | Required for Windows Graphics Capture (`IsCursorCaptureEnabled`). Older builds fall back to Electron browser capture — cursor will be visible in recordings. |
| **Linux** | Any modern distro | Recording works via Electron capture. Cursor is always visible in recordings. System audio requires PipeWire (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 34+). |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Windows, if your build is older than 19041, recording will still work but **the cursor cannot be hidden** from the captured video.

# Usage

## Record

1. Launch Recordly
2. Select a screen or window
3. Choose audio recording options
4. Start recording
5. Stop recording to open the editor

---

## Edit

Inside the editor you can:

- Add zoom regions manually
- Use automatic zoom suggestions
- Adjust cursor behavior
- Trim the video
- Add speed changes
- Add annotations
- Style the frame

Save your work anytime as a `.recordly` project.

---

## Export

Export options include:

- **MP4** for full-quality video
- **GIF** for lightweight sharing

Adjust:

- Aspect ratio
- Output resolution
- Quality settings

---

# Limitations

### Cursor Capture

**macOS**: Cursor is excluded from the recording at the ScreenCaptureKit level — always clean.

**Windows**: Cursor is excluded via Windows Graphics Capture (`IsCursorCaptureEnabled(false)`) — requires **Windows 10 Build 19041+**. On older builds the app falls back to Electron’s browser capture and the real cursor will be visible in the recording.

**Linux**: Electron’s desktop capture API does not support cursor hiding. The real OS cursor will always be visible in recordings. If you also enable the animated cursor overlay in the editor, you may see **two cursors** in the output.

Improving cross-platform cursor capture is an area where contributions are welcome.

---

### System Audio

System audio capture depends on platform support.

**Windows**
- Works out of the box via native WASAPI
- Requires Windows 10 Build 19041+

**Linux**
- Requires PipeWire (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 34+)
- Older PulseAudio setups may not support system audio

**macOS**
- Requires macOS 12.3+
- Uses ScreenCaptureKit helper

---

# How It Works

Recordly is a **desktop video editor with a renderer-driven motion pipeline and platform-specific capture layer**.

**Capture**
- Electron orchestrates recording
- macOS uses native helpers for ScreenCaptureKit and cursor telemetry
- Windows uses native WGC for screen capture

**Motion**
- Zoom regions
- Cursor tracking
- Speed changes
- Timeline edits

**Rendering**
- Scene composition handled by **PixiJS**

**Export**
- Frames rendered through the same scene pipeline
- Encoded to MP4 or GIF

**Projects**
- `.recordly` files store the source video path and editor state

---

# Contribution

All contributors welcomed!

Areas where help is especially valuable:

- Smooth cursor pipeline for **Linux**
- **Webcam** overlay bubble
- **Localisation** support, especially Chinese
- UI/UX **design** **improvements**
- **Export speed** improvements

Please:
- Keep pull requests **focused and modular**
- Test playback, editing, and export flows
- Avoid large unrelated refactors

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.
